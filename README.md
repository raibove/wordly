## Wordly
### A Fun and Challenging Word Game for Reddit

Wordly is a memory-based game designed for Reddit users, developed using Devvit. The game challenges your ability to memorize words and spot subtle changes under time pressure. It's simple, fun, and a great way to test your cognitive skills!

## ðŸ“œ How to Play

- You'll see five words displayed on your screen for a few seconds.
- Memorize these words carefully!
- The words will disappear briefly.
- When they reappear, one word will be different.
- Your task is to identify the changed word.

Do you have what it takes to spot the difference? Play now and find out!

### Credits

This project was made possible using the following open source code:

1. Devvit Webview React - Used as the base template for building Reddit apps with React & webview.
2. Redis Integration in Game - Referred code from this repository to understand how to use redis to store players scores and game data.

## Setting up your own Wordly Game

> Make sure you have Node 22 downloaded on your machine before running!

```sh
git clone https://github.com/raibove/wordly

cd wordly

npm install
```

Before continuing, make a subreddit on Reddit.com. This will be where you do your own development. Go to Reddit.com, scroll the left side bar down to communities, and click "Create a community."

Next, go to the `package.json` and update see the `dev:devvit` command. Update the command to have you subreddit name.

Finally go to `devvit.yaml` and name your app. It has to be 0-16 characters. Once you have, click save, and run `npm run upload` from the root of the repository.

Now all you have to do is run `npm run dev` and navigate to the subreddit.

There is one last gotcha! You need to make a new post before you can see it. You can do so by going to your subreddit, clicking the three dots, and tapping "Create Wordly Game". After you start developing your all please update the menu item copy (found in `src/main.tsx`).

## Commands

- `npm run dev`: Starts a development server where you can develop your application live on Reddit.
- `npm run upload`: Uploads a new version of your app
- `npm run vite`: Useful to run just the React app on your machine if you need to style things quickly.
